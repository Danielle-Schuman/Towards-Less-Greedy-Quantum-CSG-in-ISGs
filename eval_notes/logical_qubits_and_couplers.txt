Logical qubits & couplers vs. physical qubits

Graph 12,0:
Kochenberger: 144 logical qubits, 1728 "logical couplers", less physical qubits
R-QUBO: 132 logical qubits, but 8778 "logical couplers", more physical qubits
→ Makes sense: Just more / different values in QUBO formulation

5-split:
Graph 26, 0: Kochenberger: 130 logical qubits, 2015 logical couplers, less physical qubits
R-QUBO: 104 logical qubits, 5460 logical couplers, more physical qubits

4-split:
Graph 26, 0:
Kochenberger: 104 logical qubits, 1560 logical couplers, more physical qubits
R-QUBO: 78 logical qubits, 3081 logical couplers, less physical qubits

=> there seems to be some point / threshold at which the "more logical couplers" outweighs the "less logical qubits" for embedding
